# AoC-Python-Template

This is a template based on my 2023 Python solution found in this [repo](https://github.com/Anshuman-UCSB/Advent-Of-Code)

To use, clone the repo and install the library aocd with the following command
`pip install advent-of-code-data`
and also export your token, as shown in the quickstart section [here](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/)
