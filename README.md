# AoC-Python-Template

This is a template based on my 2023 Python solution found in this [repo](https://github.com/Anshuman-UCSB/Advent-Of-Code)

To use, clone the repo and install the library aocd with the following command
`pip install advent-of-code-data`
and also export your token, as shown in the quickstart section [here](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/)

To run it, call `main.py`, and try calling `main.py --help` to see descriptions of its functionality.

Your input files will automatically be written if using aocd, if not just modify the input file in the respective directory.

You can add any test cases to the tests/ folder for each day, just create a new file and place the test case in there and pass in the `-t` flag or `-d` flag while calling main.
